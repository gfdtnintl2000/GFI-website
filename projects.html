<h2>Green Dignity Villages</h2>
<p>
Grace Foundation International is spearheading Green Dignity Villages — a transformative initiative that provides sustainable, affordable, and climate‑smart housing to vulnerable rural communities in Kenya.
</p>
<p>
These villages integrate renewable energy, clean water, smart sanitation, and homegrown food systems into eco‑friendly homes built with compressed stabilized earth blocks (CSEBs). Each unit is equipped with solar power, rainwater harvesting, composting toilets or biodigesters, and vertical gardens.
</p>
<p>Designed for women‑headed households, persons with disabilities, and climate‑affected families.</p>
