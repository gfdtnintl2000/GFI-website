  <h3>Green Dignity Villages</h3>
  <p>
    Grace Foundation International is spearheading <strong>Green Dignity Villages</strong> â€” a transformative initiative that provides sustainable, affordable, and climate-smart housing to vulnerable rural communities in Kenya.
  </p>
  <p>
    These villages integrate renewable energy, clean water, smart sanitation, and homegrown food systems into eco-friendly homes built with compressed stabilized earth blocks (CSEBs). Each unit is equipped with solar power, rainwater harvesting, composting toilets or biodigesters, and vertical gardens.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designed for women-headed households, persons with disabilities, and climate-affected families, this initiative reimagines rural housing as a catalyst for resilience, dignity, and holistic community development.
