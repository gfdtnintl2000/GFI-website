      <h2>Message from the Founder</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Grace Foundation International.</p>
      <p>
        What began as a simple desire to uplift lives in the South Rift region of Kenya has grown into a movement of hope, dignity, and transformation.
        At Grace Foundation, we believe that education, sustainable agriculture, accessible healthcare, and community empowerment are not just programs—they are
        vital pathways to restoring dreams and building a just, healthy, and prosperous future for generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are especially committed to reaching the most vulnerable with essential services that nourish the mind, body, and spirit. Health is not a privilege;
        it is a basic right—and we are working to make that a reality for every household we serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your interest in our work means everything. Whether you’re a donor, partner, volunteer, or friend, thank you for joining hands with us. Together,
        we can nurture potential, ignite change, and leave a legacy of compassion and progress.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Warm regards,<br>Dr. Joseph Kipkemoi Ronoh<br><em>Founder, Grace Foundation International</em></strong></p>
